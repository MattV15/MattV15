# Hello! I'm Matt Van Duyn, a junior transfer student majoring in Information Sciences!

I am currently interested in HCI and exploring classes and concepts related to that. 

I have some Python experience.

I graduated from College of DuPage in 2024 and transferred to University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, which I now attend.

âš¡A fun fact about me is I have a _very_ cute dog!

I also enjoy video games and reading.

The project I have most recently worked on was a hypothetical open-source project involving the implementation of a volunteer portal for a hypothetical food pantry: Kindness Place Food Pantry. 

ðŸ˜„I will continue exploring and figuring everything out!
